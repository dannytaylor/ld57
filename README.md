depth map/z-buffer concept for ludum dare 57's theme "depths". use your depth sensor camera + special batteries to apply properties to interactables. wanted to have a bit more of an interesting implementation and do some more complicated and perspective-based puzzles, but didn't end up happening. made in godot.
